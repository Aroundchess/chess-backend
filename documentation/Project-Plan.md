I'm planning to build a backend-only service for my chess application, focused solely on handling API requests. This service will facilitate interactions with the frontend of my full-stack application.

Objective: The backend API will serve as a learning tool for understanding chess from principles to high level expertise.

Project Planning:

1. Define Service Boundaries:
   - Identify core functionalities: game state management, move validation, player statistics, etc.
   - Establish clear service responsibilities to ensure scalability and maintainability.

2. Design API Contract:
   - Start with a simple health-check endpoint: `GET /api/v1/health-check`
     - Example Request: `GET /api/v1/health-check`
     - Example Response: `{ "status": "healthy" }`
   - Plan additional endpoints for chess-specific functionalities, such as:
     - `POST /api/v1/games` to start a new game
     - `POST /api/v1/games/{gameId}/move` to make a move
     - `GET /api/v1/games/{gameId}` to retrieve game state

3. Technology Stack:
   - Use Node.js with Express for a lightweight and scalable server.
   - Implement a NoSQL database like MongoDB for flexible game state storage.
   - Utilize Redis for caching frequently accessed data, such as player rankings.

4. Database Schema:
   - Design collections for games, players, and moves, ensuring necessary indexes for quick access.

5. Security and Performance:
   - Integrate JWT for authentication.
   - Implement rate limiting to protect against abuse.
   - Plan for horizontal scaling through container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes).

6. Potential Bottlenecks:
   - Consider caching strategies to reduce database load.
   - Monitor API response times and optimize query performance.

Let's proceed with the design of the initial health-check API and lay the foundation for a scalable, efficient backend service.
